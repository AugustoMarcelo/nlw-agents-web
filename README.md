# NLW Agents

This project, **NLW Agents**, was implemented during a Rocketseat event. It is a real-time Q&A web application that allows users to create rooms and ask questions using text or audio input, with answers generated by AI.

## Tech Stack

- **React** (with TypeScript)
- **Vite** (for fast development and build)
- **React Router DOM** (for routing)
- **TanStack Query** (for API data fetching and caching)
- **React Hook Form** (for form handling)
- **Zod** (for schema validation)
- **Radix UI** (for accessible UI components)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)
- **DayJS** (for date formatting)
- **@biomejs/biome** (for code formatting and linting)

## Features

- Create and join rooms
- Text-based question submission
- Real-time question tracking
- Audio recording support (in development)
- AI-powered answers
- Mobile-responsive design
- Form validation
- Optimistic updates
